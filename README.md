<img src="./images/lotto.jpg" alt="Lotto" width="92%">

**Lotto** is a state machine-based hardware game written in SystemVerilog, designed as an exercise to explore **common pitfalls**  in digital design.

## 🔍 Approach

This module is meant to be solved via **static analysis**, not simulation.  
Audit the design, and use the **DigitalJS VSCode plugin** to inspect the synthesized gate-level logic.
